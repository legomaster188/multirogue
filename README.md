# ☠ MultiRogue

A **multiplayer ASCII roguelike**. One shared, procedurally-generated dungeon;
everyone connected plays in the same world in real time.

## Run

```bash
npm install
npm start            # serves http://localhost:3000
```

Open the URL in a browser (multiple tabs, or other machines on your network via
`http://<your-ip>:3000`). Each tab is a separate hero.

## Play

| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| `WASD` / arrows | move (bump a monster to attack; bump a fallen ally to revive) |
| `Y U B N` | move diagonally |
| `F` | fire ranged attack at the nearest visible foe (Mage/Ranger) |
| `>` / `<` | descend / climb stairs (while standing on them) |
| `Q` | quaff your first potion |
| `1`–`9` | quaff a specific potion from your belt (or click it) |
| `E` | eat a food ration |
| `R` / `T` | read scroll of magic mapping / teleportation |
| `Enter` | chat with the party |

On phones/tablets an on-screen **D-pad and action buttons** appear automatically.

### Classes

Pick a class when you join:

- **Warrior** — high HP, strong melee, starts armored. The frontline tank.
- **Mage** — fragile, but fires `magic bolt`s at range with a strong punch.
- **Ranger** — balanced, with fast-recharging `arrow`s at long range.

### The quest (modeled on the original *Rogue*)

The dungeon is **dark** — rooms light up only when you enter them, and corridors reveal
just the squares beside you. Explored ground is remembered, dimmed. Each player has their
own field of view, but you all crawl one **persistent** dungeon, so a floor you cleared
stays cleared and the party can split across depths.

- **Goal:** descend to **depth 8**, defeat the **Yendor Warden** (`W`) guarding the
  **Amulet of Yendor** (`"`), and carry the Amulet back up to the surface (`<` on depth 1)
  to win.
- **Hunger:** your `Sated → Hungry → Weak → Starving` clock ticks down. Eat rations (`%`)
  with `E` or you'll starve to death.
- **Gear:** pick up weapons (`)`) for `+ATK` and armor (`[`) for armor class, which soaks
  incoming damage. Better gear auto-equips.
- **Ranged combat:** Mages and Rangers press `F` to strike the nearest foe in sight — a
  bolt streaks across the map. Warriors fight up close.
- **Potions** (`!`) come in random colours each run — drink one to learn what it does
  (and the whole party learns too). Types: *healing*, *strength* (+ATK), *speed* (haste —
  move twice as fast for a while), and the occasional *harmful* brew. Manage your belt with
  the number keys.
- **Scrolls** (`?`): *magic mapping* (`R`) reveals the whole floor; *teleportation* (`T`)
  blinks you to a random spot.
- **Merchant** (`P`): a travelling shopkeeper sets up every 3rd floor. Bump into them to
  trade gold for potions, food, scrolls, and weapon/armor upgrades — so gold finally matters.
- **Hall of Fame:** winning or dying records your score (gold + level + kills + depth, with
  a big bonus for escaping with the Amulet). Top runs persist across sessions.
- **Loot & combat:** grab `$` gold and `!` potions; kill monsters
  (`b`at → `r`at → `k`obold → `s`nake → `o`rc → `z`ombie → `T`roll → `D`ragon, scaling with
  depth) for XP and level up (+HP/+ATK). Slain monsters may drop gold. **Snakes poison** you.
- **Traps** (`^`) hide in the floor — dart traps wound you, trap doors fling you across
  the level. They reveal once sprung.
- **Co-op revive:** when you fall you become **downed** (`%`) for 18 seconds. An ally who
  steps into you pulls you back to half health. If no one reaches you in time, you die,
  respawn at the entrance, and lose half your gold — and if you carried the Amulet, it
  drops where you fell.

`@` is you, `&` are other heroes (only visible when in your line of sight).

## Play online (over the internet)

The server is host-ready: it binds all interfaces, respects `$PORT`, and the client
auto-upgrades to secure `wss://` when served over HTTPS. Deploy it anywhere that runs
Node and share the URL — anyone who opens it joins the same live dungeon.

- **Render** (free): push this repo, create a *Blueprint* — `render.yaml` is detected
  automatically.
- **Docker**: `docker build -t multirogue . && docker run -p 3000:3000 multirogue`
- **Any Node host** (Railway, Fly.io, a VPS): run `npm install && npm start`.

For a quick public link from your own machine, a tunnel works too:
`npx localtunnel --port 3000` (or `cloudflared tunnel --url http://localhost:3000`).

## Architecture

- `server.js` — authoritative game server. Owns persistent per-depth levels, monster
  AI, combat, loot, hunger, and the win condition. Ticks every 200ms; computes a
  **per-player** snapshot (each hero sees only their own field of view) and sends it
  over WebSocket. Players move in real time (rate-limited to one step/tick). Monster AI
  only runs on floors that currently have players.
- `public/index.html` — thin client: renders the fog-of-war grid, HUD (HP/XP/hunger,
  gear, depth, Amulet), party roster, legend, and log/chat; sends input. No game logic
  lives here, so clients can't cheat or see through walls.
- `test-client.mjs` — headless smoke test (fog-of-war, HUD, classes, ranged, movement).
- `test-descend.mjs` — pathfinding bot that explores, descends, and climbs back.
- `test-coop.mjs` — verifies ranged combat and the downed → revive co-op loop. Run the
  server with `MR_TEST=1` first (it enables an inert-in-production self-damage test hook).
- `test-shop.mjs` — a bot descends to the merchant floor, opens the shop, and quaffs a
  typed potion.

Authoritative-server design means all players always agree on the world state, and
since visibility is computed server-side, the unexplored map is never sent to a client.
